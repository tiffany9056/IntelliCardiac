## Testing Data
Sample testing data can be found in the `testing_image/` folder.

## Introduction
IntelliCardiac is a full-stack medical imaging web platform designed for cardiac segmentation and disease classification using cine MRI.

By combining a deep learning-based segmentation model with a two-stage classification pipeline, IntelliCardiac achieves a segmentation accuracy of 92.6%. The classification module—trained on features extracted from segmented heart structures—reaches 98% accuracy across five diagnostic categories.

These results outperform current state-of-the-art systems that integrate both segmentation and classification. Supporting real-time visualization, workflow integration, and AI-assisted diagnostics, IntelliCardiac shows strong promise as a scalable, accurate tool for clinical decision-making in cardiac imaging.
